            <h5> Hello üëãüèº Thanks for dropping by my portfolio! Im a second year student studying Computational Media at Georgia <br> Tech with concentrations in UIUX Design as well as minoring in Industrial Design. Outside of school I am <br>involved in Engage Ventures as a Design & Communications Intern, where I am currently working on web design and <br>rebranding and HackGT as a Designer, where I am working on HackGT 7 (our annual flagship hackathon!!!). I am <br>also a new active member of the Alpha Omega Epsilon Sorority at Georgia Tech, which promotes women in STEM and <br>really loving my new family.

                <br>I am always looking for opportunities to grow and expand my horizons as a designer. I am looking for experience in UI/UX <br>mobile and web applications. I look forward be a part of a collaborative team focused on ongoing innovation and problem <br>solving in UI UX/Product Design while identifying design needs and creating interactive mockups and prototypes to create <br>delightful, intuitive experiences. Leveraging from my design and computer science backgrounds, I will bring fresh ideas to <br>the table to develop the best impactful solutions to effectively analyze, design, and code challenges. I‚Äôm eager to engage <br>with others to make a difference in the world by thinking outside of the box with multiple angles.
