                        <h5> Interning at Engage Ventures on their design team, my job was to come up with marketing materials such as presentations, badges/business cards, and videos to display the company's image effectively. Engage Ventures is a company that promotes startups and it is my role as a designer to present information and leave a strong positive impression during events about these companies. I worked on things like business cards, videos, and badges.</h5>

                        <h5> HackGT7: Reimagine Reality will welcome 2,500 participants this Fall from all over the country to learn new things and build new worlds. With special circumstances, forming teams in person would be difficult to achieve. To break the boundaries of being a virtual event, my goal is to create a platform that allows participants from all over the world to connect with one another and find teammates seamlessly. I had the goal to encourage engagement among people and make new friends.</h5>

                        <h5>Catalyst is a hackathon presented by HackGT, which is directed towards high school students in the Metro Atlanta Area. We encourage underserved students to learn about the world of STEAM through engaging tracks such as Robotics, InfoSecurity, Gaming, and Music Tech. As a key team member and a designer, I helped bring the vision of HackGT to life. I design badges, live sites, marketing materials, as well as swag (T-shirts, bags, stickers). I also help organize the actual hackathon itself.</h5>

I applied my collage to three different formats including a digital album cover, a vinyl CD, and a social media boomerang gif. I thought about about how different aspect ratios and uses will affect my design and communication.</h5>
